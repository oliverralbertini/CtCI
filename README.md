Working on problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview" (doing them in C).

The book "Cracking the Coding Interview" is by Gayle Laackmann McDowell, website: http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/

The solutions in the book are given in Java, but I am trying them in C in order to learn more about memory management and how to implement things like linked lists and hash tables.
